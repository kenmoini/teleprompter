<p>Howdy gang and welcome to a new short series on setting up a developer environment!</p>
<p>I'm working with a buddy, he's learning DevOps, we've got some code shared on GitHub and a CI/CD pipeline set to build and deploy his app.</p>
<p>Problem is, we're working right out of the GitHub GUI which is ok to get started, but at a certain point you need a real local development environment for quicker testing - that doesn't get pushed to production.</p>
<p>We'll be building an Ubuntu Development VM that houses everything that we need, doesn't touch our main system, and can be thrown out and rebuilt in a moments notice.</p>
<p>You could of course do plenty of good development work with your local operating system, but this way our dev environment is in its own sandbox - plus this way there's better compatibility with Docker.</p>
<p>Anywho, we'll be downloading Ubuntu and Virtualbox, creating a VM and installing Ubuntu, doing some basic updates, installing and setting up some tools, and towards the end we'll even do some basic collaboration and workflows with Git and build a Docker container or two.</p>
<p>All this, and maybe a little more, starts in this next video - join me as we start down the Dev side of DevOps.</p>
