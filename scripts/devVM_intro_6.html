<p>Howdy gang and welcome!</p>
<p>Now that we have all of the tools we need to build some software let's do some work with Git.</p>
<p>Git is a form of Source Code Management, defined primarily as the open-source decentralized platform and protocol that build the foundations of services such as GitHub and GitLab.</p>
<p>Git is really handy because it tracks your codebase changes, can help organize, and makes it much easier for others to collaborate.</p>
<p>In this series we'll be working out of GitHub.  If you don't already have a GitHub account, well, all I gotta say is that it's the year 2020 and you don't have a GitHub account?</p>
<p>Ok, that's ok, I understand, I guess.  How about this, pause this video, go sign up and come back, I'll wait.</p>
<p>Insert waiting stops</p>
<p>Insert waiting stops</p>
<p>Oh, hey, you're back!</p>
<p>Well, you can learn more about Git, GitHub, and whatnot with the links provided below, but for now we'll jump right into configuring our local Git client and generating some secure keys to better authenticate with GitHub.</p>
