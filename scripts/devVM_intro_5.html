<p>Howdy gang and welcome!</p>
<p>Now we have the ability to build, manipulate, and run containers.</p>
<p>What we need now are some local libraries and runtimes.</p>
<p>This can differ from developer to developer, environment to environment.</p>
<p>We're going to add a number of language runtimes such as Golang, NodeJS, OpenJDK, Python, and PHP to this VM for a pretty well-balanced set up - you can pick and choose as you'd like.</p>
