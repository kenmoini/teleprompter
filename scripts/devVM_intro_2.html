<p>Howdy gang and welcome!</p>
<p>Let's kick things off by downloading a few things that we'll need to set up this Developer VM.</p>
<p>Two things we need to grab are a copy of the Ubuntu Linux Desktop ISO and the VirtualBox hypervisor.</p>
<p>I'd normally suggest deploying Red Hat Enterprise Linux, there's a free Developer Subscription anyone can get.</p>
<p>However, some would argue that Ubuntu linux is easier for beginners so I went with that for this install.</p>
<p>VirtualBox is a type-2 virtualization hypervisor that can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<p>Anywho, how about we dive right in...</p>
