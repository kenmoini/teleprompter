# Teleprompter

Teleprompter displays scripts formatted as HTML, Markdown, or plain text,
scrolling the script consistently. A second web browser can be attached to a
"control" view for that script, able to control or stop the scroll speed and
jump back to the top of the script. Each scrolling view can be adjusted to
conform to different equipment needs.

This is based on the teleprompter software by Schonology https://github.com/Schoonology/teleprompter
Fixes have been included to patch the screen mirroring, and additional functionality has been added to enable keyboard input on the Control pages.  Read more about the Keyboard Input below, which can also be used with an AirMouse that has directional buttons and Start/Stop.

## Installation

1. Install [Node][node].
2. Open a shell. On Windows, this will be the Command Prompt. On Mac OS X, this
should be Terminal.
3. In a shell, type `npm install -g teleprompter`. If you get an `EACCESS`
error at the end, you may have to run `sudo npm install -g teleprompter`
instead.

[node]: https://nodejs.org/

## Basic usage

1. Open a shell. (If it's still open from installing, that's fine.)
2. Use the `cd` command to change the current working directory to where your
scripts live. For example, if your scripts are located at
`/Users/schoon/Scripts`, you'd type `cd /Users/schoon/Scripts`.
3. In that same shell, run `teleprompter`.
4. You should see a basic greeting, which includes instructions for connecting
devices to your newly-running server. _Follow the instructions!_
5. Have fun!

## Basic physical setup

A setup that has worked well in studios so far has included the following:

- A MacBook or iMac running `teleprompter`.
- An iPad or other tablet used as the teleprompter display (the one physically
  co-located with the camera).
- A second tablet used as a monitor for the Teleprompter operator.
- A smartphone connected to that script's Control view, also for the
  Teleprompter operator.
  
## OpenShift Installation

## Detailed usage

Teleprompter expects to be run against a directory of text files. If
unspecified, the current working directory is used instead.

```
Usage: teleprompter [OPTIONS] <scripts>

Options:
  <scripts>       A directory of scripts to load. [Default: .]
  --help, -h      Print usage information, then exit.
  --port, -p      Specify the port to listen on. [Default: 8080]
```

Teleprompter will run a web server at the configured port, so ensure the port
is available to use. A reasonable default, 8080, has been provided, and
shouldn't collide with other applications. (If it _does_ collide, you probably
know well enough to change it.)

## Browser Support

For best results, use the newest browser supported by your platform. For iOS
and Android, this will probably be Safari and Android, respectively. For older
phones and tablets, however, a more up-to-date browser may be available through
the App Store and Play Store. When [filing issues][new-issue], please let us
know the browser you ran into trouble with, and we'll see what we can do!

## Routes

Once Teleprompter is running successfully, a web browser can be pointed at any
of the routes listed below, replacing `{script}` with the name of the script's
file, excluding the extension. For example, if you want to load the file
`glow-cloud.md` or `dog-park.html`, you would use `glow-cloud` or `dog-park` in
the URL, respectively.

Name | URL | Description
-----|-----|------------
Dashboard | `/` | Displays all available scripts and metadata for Teleprompter itself.
Script | `/{script}` | Displays the named script, rendering any Markdown to HTML.
Control | `/{script}/control` | Controls all Script displays for the named script.

## Developing for Teleprompter

Two additional routes exist for internal synchronization of Control and Script
displays. Any event posted to the Publish route is sent to all clients attached
to the Subscribe socket, where `{namespace}` is any string, generally the name
of the script being displayed.

Name | URL | Description
-----|-----|------------
Subscribe (EventSource) | `GET /{namespace}/events` | An EventSource stream of updates.
Publish | `POST /{namespace}/events` | Pushes a new event to all subscribers.

These events arrive in the form of JSON with a `type` field (in addition to the
`text/event-stream`-provided `event` field) and additional metadata.

The table below lists the available events and their desired effects.

Name | Description
-----|------------
`content` | The content itself has been updated, and the Script client should reload.
`position` | The scroll position should be reset to `y`, defaulting to `0` (top).
`speed` | The scroll speed should be updated to `speed`, defaulting to `0` (stop).

## Keyboard Input

The following keys have been mapped to the various control options on the Control route.

- **Left Arrow Key** - Decrease Speed
- **Right Arrow Key** - Increase Speed
- **Up Arrow Key** - Previous Section
- **Down Arrow Key** - Next Section
- **P** - Play/Pause
- **Escape** - Stop/Start

Personally I have the "Zoweetek Wireless Presenter with Mouse Functions and Red Laser" device and it works great.  If you have another device that uses different keys, like maybe the actual Play/Stop media keys, it's easy to swap the input actuation:

1. Grab your desired Key Code from https://keycode.info/
2. Change lines 142+ to your desired input functions
3. Present
